Include orders
--------------

All includes should be sorted in alphabetical order.
Furthermore the includes should be splited into the three following groups:

1.  c++/c libraries
2.  extern libraries
3.  internal headers

Between every group should be a free line.

Variable names
--------------

* class member variables start with m_
  * m_name or m_type
* variable names have no underscores

clamps (),{}
------------

* between for, if an the clamp is one free space
  * if (...) or for (...)
* the first bracket is set behind the function name or the instruction
  * void foo (...) { 
  * ...
  * }
